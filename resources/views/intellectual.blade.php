                <p>
                    Intellectual disability, formerly referred as “mental retardation”, is majorly taken as a punishment to the sins committed in earlier life and is also taken as lack of virtue in the family. It is neither a punishment nor it should be confused as any mental illness or disease. There is no cure as such as this is not a disease but a condition. Persons with intellectual disability are those who are characterized by their development at below-average rate with impaired cognitive functioning, and experience difficulty in learning, adaptive behavior and social adjustment. It is an issue where the intellectual, cognitive, adaptive skills and functioning get impaired and limited thus leading to restriction, more or less in their daily life activities in the conceptual, social and practical areas of day to day functioning. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    People with intellectual disability need same and equal basic services that every individual need for normal development. They develop in the same way as other persons but at a slower rate. They may take longer time to learn language, learn to be self-reliant in activities of daily living, develop communication skills for expression, develop adaptive behaviour skills and social skills, etc. than the persons living without intellectual disability. They learn and develop more slowly and with more difficulty than the ones without disability. The level of their learning depends on various factors like their intelligence level, multiple impairments they have, their field of interest, the way they are trained, resources and materials used to teach/train them, environment they live in, love and support, etc. determine their learning rate of development.

        <p>
            But it cannot be denied that persons living with intellectual disability are able to learn, become self-reliant and live an independent life becoming a member of the society. The matter is how much they achieve in their life as not everyone has the same level of the intelligence and multiple impairments they suffer from.  
        </p>

            It has caused a universal anxiety and left none. Parents of such children are burdened into anxious situation thinking their children's obscure future. Even such issue does exist at every strata of the society; the level of social consciousness towards these children with intellectual disability still remains negligible.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the uncertain fate there remains no solution except to accept the destiny as it comes and train them to the best to bettering their lives. Since the time of birth with intellectual disability or a person happens to be living with intellectual disability in later life before the age of 18, the acceptance of the child gets indifferent at their home itself. Parents should accept the fact that their child is mentally challenged and help him/her grow to the full potential that s/he is capable of. Unless the parents accept this fact at home first, the lives of children with intellectual disability will not get away from taboo, stigma and discrimination in the outer world.
